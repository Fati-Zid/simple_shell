# Simple Shell

## Overview

The Simple Shell project presents a C language implementation of a user-friendly shell. This endeavor is driven by the pursuit of fundamental programming proficiency and a comprehensive understanding of C programming.

## Getting Started

To explore and utilize the Simple Shell, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository using the following command:
  git clone https://github.com/Fati-Zid/simple_shell.git
- Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd simple_shell`
- Compile the shell program:
  `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
`
- Run the Simple Shell: `./hsh`

## Functionality

Key functions integrated into our Simple Shell include:

- `access`
- `chdir`
- `close`
- `closedir`
- `execve`
- `exit`
- `_exit`
- `fflush`
- `fork`
- `malloc`
- `wait`
- ...and an array of other essential functions.
